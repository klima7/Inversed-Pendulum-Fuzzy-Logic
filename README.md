Following scenarios are considered:
- Only keeping pendulum balanced (directories with balanced prefix)
- Keeping pendulum balanced in the center (directories with centered prefix)

Aforemenshioned scenarios are acomplished in two ways:
- With high level SciKit-Fuzzy interface (directories with high suffix)
- With low level SciKit-Fuzzy interface (directories with low suffix)

You can knock the pendulum out of balance using the arrow keys.

# Running
Run `python3` on `start.py` script inside one of root directories.
